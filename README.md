# A really basic networking abstraction layer
I personally wouldn't exactly call it production ready, but whatever I'll be using it for it will probably be enough. 
It is also missing some exception handling, and a reliable UDP transport. 

I probably wont focus on updating this repo too much, considering the purpose of this is just to avoid rewriting the entire networking stack again.

Supports both `UDP` and `TCP` transports. `UDP` as of now, is only implemented for unreliable data transfer.
