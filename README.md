# vikinet2
A C# library to simplify TCP and UDP network traffic, for games or whatever else you may need.
I probably wont focus on updating this repo too much, considering the purpose of this is just to avoid rewriting the entire networking stack again.

Supports both `UDP` and `TCP` transports. `UDP` as of now, is only implemented for unreliable data transfer.

The project is configured to be a DLL by default, however feel very, very free to just copy and paste all the files!
